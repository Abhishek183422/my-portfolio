      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently working in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with hands-on experience in both research and real-world application development. As an AI/ML Research Engineer during my internship at IIT Bombay, I led deployment efforts and established the core software architecture for an innovative monkey detection system. My contributions had a significant impact on the primary Git repository, ensuring smooth integration of new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        I further honed my skills during my internship at Blurgs, working with diverse embedded systems platforms including NVIDIA Xavier, Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino Uno. My technical expertise spans Python, machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passionate about leveraging AI and ML to solve real-world problems, I have implemented projects such as an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser, active learning algorithm applications, and computer vision solutions like traffic signal recognition for the visually impaired using CNN and Arduino Uno. I am also enthusiastic about mentoring and collaborating with interns and aspiring engineers who share my passion for technology and continuous learning.
